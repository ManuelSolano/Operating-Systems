In Office 365 the function that most stands out to me is the ability to save to OneDrive like Cloud.This allows fror all of your files to be stored in your cloud/email. You wont have to worry about saving files to your computer instead of your cloud which you create once you start up Office 365.
Another Office 365 function that has helped me a lot is the ability to collabaorate with groups. Collaborating with groups has many functions like having a group conversation with only the people you are working with. Also working in the apps group workspace helps to further push productive groupwork online.
You can access Office 365 from anywhere in the world. The files stay saved in the cloud and can be acccessed by you without having your personal desktop or laptop. Being able to access your files on the go with any device is a comodity that many operating sysytems dont have.
